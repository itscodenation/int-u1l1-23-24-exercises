## Our Mission and Impact

Code Nation equips high school students in under-resourced high schools with the skills, experiences, and connections that create access to careers in technology. Our goal is to help individuals from underrepresented backgrounds gain a foothold in the tech industry. This includes female, nonbinary, Black, and Latinx individuals.

## Class Norms

- **Inclusivity:** Everyone belongs here. Give time/space for others to share, use inclusive language, and respect different backgrounds, accents, names, voices, etc.
- **Psychological Safety:** It's okay to take risks and make mistakes. The worst that will happen is you learn something!
- **Learning over Finished Product:** Your goal is to learn as much as you can. Don't let fear of imperfection or not finishing stop you.

## Meet the Instructors

Our instructors are professional software developers working in the tech industry, creating real websites, apps, and games. We'll get to know them, learning about their backgrounds, why they learned to code, and why they think it's important for you to learn coding.

## Discussion & Practice

We'll kick off a discussion about what comes to your mind when you hear the word "coding." Then, we'll list three everyday items that require coding to operate.

## Code Nation This Year

This year, you'll be learning three languages used to make websites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Apart from this, you'll be gaining communication skills, problem-solving & critical thinking skills, and building connections in the industry.

## What If I Don't Know About Coding?

That's perfectly fine! Most of our students have never coded before, but anyone can learn. Even if you think coding isn't for you, there are many other skills you'll learn in this class that are important for any future career.

## Class Registration

Next, we'll fill out the Code Nation registration form to get you all set up.

## Closing & Shout Outs

To wrap things up, we'll have a small discussion to ensure we're meeting all your needs. Then it's time for shout outs!
